            This app is designed to interface with the Thumbor image resize application, and with the Varnish server
            that caches static files for most of our websites.
        </p>
        <p class="page-info">
            When Thumbor is asked to resize an image, it downloads a local copy of the original image, stores it in
            case it has to resize it again, resizes the downloaded copy into the request dimensions, stores the resize
            in a different folder, and then returns the resized image. This app is able to remove both the original
            downloaded version as well as all resized versions.
        </p>
        <p class="page-info">
            Varnish has a lot of complex functionality, but this app only cares that Varnish can cache HTTP responses.
            Once Varnish has cached something (like an image, JavaScript file, or CSS stylesheet), this app can Purge
            that response from Varnish, Refresh the response that Varnish has cached, or send a Ban to Varnish that
            prevents Varnish from serving the cached response.
